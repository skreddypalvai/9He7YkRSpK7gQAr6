# Voice cloning and fake audio detection
## Background:
We are a technology company working in the Cyber Security industry. We focus on building systems that help individuals and organizations to have safe and secure digital presence by providing cutting edge technologies to our customers. We create products and services that ensure our customers security using data driven technologies to understand whether audio and video media is authentic or fake.
Our goal in this project is to build algorithms that can synthesize spoken audio by converting a speaker’s voice to another speaker’s voice with the end goal to detect if any spoken audio is pristine or fake.
## Data Description:
There are two datasets you can utilize in this project. Both datasets are publicly available sources.
* ### TIMIT Dataset:
The TIMIT corpus of read speech is designed to provide speech data for acoustic-phonetic studies and for the development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems. TIMIT contains a total of 6300 sentences, 10 sentences spoken by each of 630 speakers from 8 major dialect regions of the United States.

* ### CommonVoice Dataset:
Common Voice is part of Mozilla's initiative to help teach machines how real people speak. Common Voice is a corpus of speech data read by users on the Common Voice website and based upon text from a number of public domain sources like user submitted blog posts, old books, movies, and other public speech corpora. Its primary purpose is to enable the training and testing of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.

## Goal(s):
Build a machine learning system to detect if a spoken audio is synthetically generated or not. In order to achieve this, first, build a voice cloning system given a speaker’s spoken audio that clones the source speaker’s voice to the target speaker’s voice. Next, build a machine learning system which detects if any spoken audio is a natural speech or synthetically generated by machine.

## Success Metrics:
Use Word Error Rate (WER) for automatic evaluation of the voice cloning (VC) system for the speech generation part and also report speaker classification accuracy to assess the performance of the generated audio’s target speaker. For the fake audio detection (FAD) system evaluate the performance of the models using F-score via positive labels coming from the groundtruth dataset and negative labels generated by the VC.

## Results:
* ### Voice Clone Evaluation
You can notice that the WER and Similarity Score of Original text and Cloned text(cloned from pristine audio) have optimal results, Most of the cloned texts have more than 80% accuracy when compared with Original text.

 I recommend downloading the IPYNB file to listen to fake audio(cloned audio).

* ### Fake Audio Detection
We can witness that the model is able to accurately classify the Pristine and Fake Audio.
